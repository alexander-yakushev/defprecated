* DEFprecated - deprecate all the things!

  Psst, chummer! Looking for some deprecation? You've come to the right place.
  Deprecate like never before, deprecate everything! Deprecate symbols,
  deprecate functions and macros, deprecate arities, deprecate programming
  languages, deprecate hardware and software, deprecate your enemies and
  friends, deprecate your loved ones, deprecate your dog, deprecate yourself for
  eating that donut, deprecate social institutions, deprecate social injustice,
  deprecate government and FRS, deprecate NSA, deprecate yourself again for
  deprecating everything, deprecate that feeling, go on deprecation spree!

  /Did you just say "deprecate your dog"?/

  No, I didn't.

  /Can I deprecate this library?/

  Yes, you can, but then you will be responsible for writing another one.

  Listen to this testimonies!

  /"Use or delete. There is no deprecate." Master Joda/

  Sorry, that's the wrong one. Try this:

  /"We have a policy of releasing entire Java packages in which every single/
  /class, interface and method is deprecated right out of the box, starting at/
  /version 1.0." Morris Baldwin, by [[http://steve-yegge.blogspot.no/2010/07/wikileaks-to-leak-5000-open-source-java.html][Steve Yegge]]/

  /"I just do (:refer-clojure :exclude [defn defmacro]) and (:use/
  /defprecated.code)."/

** Man, you need help

   No, wait, I got this. *defprecated* is a minimalistic library for marking
   functions, macros and global vars as deprecated. When the time comes and you
   realize that you made an bad API decision, mark the function as deprecated
   instead of removing it. You'll get the best from two worlds: old users won't
   have their code crash, but they will migrate to the new API over time.
